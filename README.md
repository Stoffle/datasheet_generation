## Causal datasheet REPO. 

This repo is for generating statistics used in the datasheets found in the 'Causal Datasheet' paper.

In this example, we assume the user is running on a linux/mac machine. 

To run the code first install the python requirements from the requirements.txt; e.g.:

`conda create --name <env> --file requirements.txt`

Following this, R, along with some R libraries must be installed (ensure R > 3.6):

`. install-R-dependencies.sh`

Finally, one can then open the Jupyter notebook with:

`jupyter notebook`

or view the (notebook)[jupyter notebook](https://github.com/SurgoVentures/datasheet_generation/blob/master/run.ipynb) directly on Github.
